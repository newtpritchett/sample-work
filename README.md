Some examples of projects I completed during my undergraduate program at IIT, mostly intended for potential employers to see a snippet of my undergraduate school work.
If that's why you're here, it's worth noting that some of these projects were group projects so I'd be happy to show you which contributions were mine.
A typical deadline for these projects was about two weeks.


InspirationRewards and Stockwatch: These are relatively simple Android apps written for an App Developement course. They're primarily Java, written in Android Studio.

CS425-master: This was a project for a Database Management course. It is a book-keeping/inventory software for a car dealership. It's mostly SQL with nodejs on the server side.

project-2a-out-of-the-depths-newtpritchett-master: A functional bootloader from an upper-level Operating Systems course. Predominately C and assembly code. Theoretically, it should run on a variety of virtual machines but it's only been tested in QEMU.

project-3a-parallel-zip-duckduckno-master: A zip compression algorithmn that runs in parallel threads. It was essentially the primer for the class's final project in which we implemented Google's MapReduce (below). Written in C.

project-4b-mapreduce-funkification-master: A generalized MapReduce implementation that supports user-defined Map() and Reduce() functions. This was the final project for an upper level course on threading and kernel development.
